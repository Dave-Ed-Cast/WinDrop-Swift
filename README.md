I was bored and I was annoyed that I couldn't really use the AirDrop technology on my windows PCs, therefore I created my version of AirDrop: WinDrop.

Could I have downloaded an external app already made? Yes. Do I want to? No (I don't have trust issues) Do I want to learn something and use it for my every day needs? Absolutely yes.

I could have written an entire long README with an important message, but why not be honest from the start?

This is one repository (Check WinDrop-C for the other part).
